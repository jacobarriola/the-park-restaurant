			<h1>About us</h1>
			<p>We are a casual, moderately priced, unpretentious, friendly neighborhood restaurant.  Our food is seasonally influenced modern American cuisine with heavy ethnic components.  We strive to delight our diners by offering thoughtfully prepared classic dishes that evoke their essential quality and by offering creative inventive dishes that are exciting and bold.  Our wines and beers are selected to pair with the food and represent the same value proposition of high quality and affordable prices.</p>

			<p>When you visit The Park, whether you are dropping in for some burgers and fries or are coming to celebrate a special occasion, we aim to provide excellent and appropriate service.  We are constantly learning, improving and growing in order to offer a higher quality experience for our guests.  From carefully sourcing our ingredients to producing many of our products in-house we aim to leave you feeling restored, replenished, and just generally better than when you walked in our door.</p>
